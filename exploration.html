                <p>A rocket  is a missile, spacecraft,
                   aircraft or other vehicle that obtains thrust from a rocket engine. Rocket engine 
                   exhaust is formed entirely from propellant carried within the rocket before use.[2]
                    Rocket engines work by action and reaction and push rockets forward simply by expelling
                   and can therefore work in the 
                     vacuum of space.</p>

                   discovered and is the largest known plutoid. 
                   Pluto was discovered by Clyde Tombaugh in 1930 
                   and was originally considered to be the ninth planet from the Sun.</p>
